# 📱 Almost Stress-Less NumberSearch App 🕵️‍♂️

Hello, World! 👋 Welcome to my quirky creation, the **Almost Stress-Less NumberSearch App**. This app is a testament to my "do-it-yourself" spirit, born from a mix of curiosity, slight annoyance, and a dash of humor. 🚀

## The Backstory 📖

Ever been bugged by calls from unknown numbers? Yep, me too! I was tired of declining calls only to find myself manually searching to see if they were worth a callback. So, I thought, why not make an app for that? And voilà, this little brainchild was born! 🤹‍♂️

## How This Nifty App Works 🧙‍♂️

- **Incoming Call Alert**: Get a call from a number not in your contacts? My app jumps into detective mode.
- **To Search or Not to Search**: A notification pops up, asking if you're in the mood to do some number sleuthing. 🕵️‍♀️
- **Affirmative Action**: Hit 'Yes', and you're off to the gulesider webpage for an automatic number lookup. Easy-peasy! 🌐
- **Decline the Quest**: Choose 'No', and the app backs off, no questions asked. 🚫

## Built With Love, Java, and Android 🛠️

This app is my playground for diving into the depths of Android development, fueled by Java and a sprinkle of creativity. It's a DIY adventure from start to finish! 🎢

## Disclaimer (The Serious Part) 📝

- It's not available on Google Play, and there are no plans to release it commercially.

## Future Dreams and Schemes 💭
